<p>A cookie clicker mod that changes the wrinkler limit</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>  The wrinkler limit is now based on how many times you&#39;ve reached the 3rd stage of the grandmapocalypse <strong>in previous ascensions.</strong></p>
<p>  When loading the mod, very little should noticeably change. To get started, buy the new Heavenly Upgrade named &quot;Memory of the Elders,&quot; which is unlocked after buying &quot;Elder spice&quot;. The grandmas will now revisit their wrath upon new reincarnations.</p>
<p>  After a while, there will start to be too many wrinklers to pop manually. To combat that, buy the Heavenly Upgrade named &quot;Holy touch,&quot; which is unlocked after buying &quot;Memory of the Elders&quot;.</p>
<p>  Note: after around 100 wrinklers, new wrinklers will spawn on a second row. Also, wrinklers max out at 1000 with around 80 elder pacts (by design).</p>
<p>  Have fun, and make sure to let me know of any problems/suggestions you have!</p>

<h4 id="through-a-bookmark-">Through a bookmark:</h4>
<p>Save the link below to a bookmark (or just paste into the searchbar), then click it whenever you want to load the mod. Make sure the &quot;javascript:&quot; part is saved, chrome sometimes deletes that part when pasting. If not, just manually add it.</p>
<pre><code>javascript:Game.LoadMod(<span class="hljs-symbol">'https</span>://github.com/awes12/WrinklersPlusPlus/blob/main/src/<span class="hljs-keyword">mod</span>.js');
</code></pre><h4 id="through-a-userscript-greasemonkey-or-tampermonkey-">Through a Userscript (Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey):</h4>
<p>Provided you know how to use userscripts, paste the below into a userscript</p>
<pre><code>(<span class="hljs-name">function</span>() {

</code></pre><h2 id="cheat-functions">Cheat functions</h2>
<p>If you just want to have a bit of fun with an obscene amount of wrinklers, you can use these functions. Before you do though, make sure to save to a file. These functions shouldn&#39;t mess with the save, but best to be safe.</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-comment">//Summon multiple wrinklers. Replace n with the amount of wrinklers you want</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">//If you want all the wrinklers to be shiny, set forceShiny to true. If not, leave it out</span>
Game.summonWrinklersSetMax(n, forceShiny); 

<span class="hljs-comment">//Override the max wrinklers, but don't spawn them</span>
Game.wrinkerInfo.wrinklerOverridenMax = n; <span class="hljs-comment">//set n to the new max</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">//change the wrinkler's size (by a multiplier)</span>
Game.wrinklerInfo.wrinklerSizeModifier = p; <span class="hljs-comment">//p=.5 for half, 2 for double, etc</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">//remove the wrinkler limit (meaning the max wrinklers through normal, modded gameplay)</span>
Game.wrinklerLimit = n; <span class="hljs-comment">//new limit</span>
